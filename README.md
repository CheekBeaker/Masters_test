# Masters_test
A repository for my form of the Masters Academy node.JS course. Not.. fit for human consumption.

Did everything in plain JS, in an ugly HTML wrapper since i don't know node yet. 
Just plonk into a browser and input.

Note: 
- JSON.parse does NOT like last, trailing commas in arrays, so i couldn't make it work with them, and preserve lengths, etc. 
Delete the last comma.

This took by far too long to make because of that tiny thing..
Well, it was educational at least. Hope i will improve!
